# RestaurantRoulette

Restaurant Roulette a restaurant suggestion service for Android mobile devices.

If you and a group of people are having a hard time deciding where to eat, the app will search for nearby restaurants and will randomly select one to display.  If you are unhappy with the selection, you may decide try again.

You will also be able to add restaurant choices to a list of favorites, which will be weighted more heavily in the randomization process.

You may also choose to only include favorite restaurants in the selection process.

To extend the usefulness of the application, you may also choose to only search for a particular type of restaurant. For example, from a dropdown menu, you may select “All,” or “Chinese,” or “Pizzeria,” and the app will then only include relevant restaurants in the search.

Finally, once a restaurant has been randomly selected, basic information about the restaurant, including a rating of the restaurant, customer reviews and a map view of the restaurant's location will be displayed.
